        Minimal techno is a minimalist subgenre of techno music. It
        ischaracterized by a stripped-down aesthetic that exploits the use
        ofrepetition and understated development. Minimal techno is thought
        tohave been originally developed in the early 1990s by
        Detroit-basedproducers Robert Hood and Daniel Bell.

        Such trends saw the demise of the soul-infused techno that typified
        theoriginal Detroit sound. Robert Hood has noted that he and Daniel
        Bellboth realized something was missing from techno in the post-rave
        era.
